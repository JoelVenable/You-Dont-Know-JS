  *  Values and types perform different kinds of actions like math on numbers or output with strings.
  *  Variables store data (state) during execution.
  *  Conditionals like 'if' are used to make decisions.
  *  Loops repeat actions until a condition stops being true.
  *  Functions organize code into logical and reusable chunks. 
    *  Remember rule #1 of code:  Don't repeat yourself!!
  
  *  Comments are effective to write more readable code, which makes the program easier to understand and maintain.
  *  Don't neglect the power of practice!!!
