# You-Dont-Know-JS

Follow along with me as I make notes for the getify/You-Dont-Know-JS course.  Note that I'm using node to execute each of the .js files in my example code versus a browser, so anything I want to "see" I'll have to log out to the console.  Therefore my code will differ somewhat from the source.
